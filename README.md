# Building a Neural Net Library (Multi-Layer Perceptron) in SML (A Functional Programming Language)

This project will heavily rely on the ```value``` datatype and an automatic differentiation algorithnm that I implemented in [this repo](https://github.com/chrispyroberts/Auto-Diff-in-SML). If you are not familiar with backpropogation, or don't understand how automatic differentiation works, I recommend you read through the linked repo before reading through this.
